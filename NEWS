--- Replaced "Mean_Se" and "Mean_Sp" by "Summary_Se" and "Summary_Sp" in the SROC_rjags function
    to keep notation aligned with the upcoming COchrane DTA handbook.
--- Added new features to the Forest function:
     - summary argument (formerly mean) now supports multiple summary point estimates coming from different models.
     - summary_label argument allows to name the summary point estimates.
     - Argument "col.headers" added in order to change the headers of the forest plot columns.
     - study.cex argument now allows control over the study label font size.
     - summary.cex argument manages the fontsize of summary_label.
